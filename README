# Neural network implementation

This repo contains my codes to implement neural networks from scratch when I was learning about neural networks. I created a notebook file to show the step-by-step progress. I am sharing this code because I think it can be useful for others.

When I was trying to implement it, I got help from lots of different resources. If you see some of the codes or pictures in other resources, this is the reason.
